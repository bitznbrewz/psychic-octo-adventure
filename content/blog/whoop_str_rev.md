## Whoop Strength Trainer

## Features / Promises

## Pros

* Works well at getting muscular load if you use one of the pre-canned workouts
* If you don't have a workout plan that you're following, the basic chest and
leg routines seem like a good start

## Cons

* UI requires a lot of interactions with the phone to use
* Reps never seem to be autopopulated
* THERE'S NO WAY TO PAUSE THE WORKOUT
* Library of exercises is good, but not great
    * some fairly common ones are missing
* There's an OTHER category, but no way to label what it is

## Final Thoughts

* Good start, but really not ready to replace pen & paper for workout tracking,
at least for me
* Lot of opportunity in the future, but this definitely feels more like a 
public beta test than a v1 of a feature
* I'll re-evaluate as new updates happen
